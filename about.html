        <h3>What to know</h3>
        <p>
          Rusununguko High School, located in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, was established on
          March 7, 1981. Initially founded to accommodate ex-combatants and
          refugees, the mixed government school has evolved into one of the
          top-ranking institutions in Mashonaland East. Our school holds
          historical significance, being rooted in the post-independence era as
          part of Zimbabwe‚Äôs Education with Production (ZIMFEP) initiative. The
          school's philosophy integrates education with production, promoting
          the dignity of labor and hands-on learning experiences. Beyond
          academics, Rusununguko High School promotes a philosophy of education
          that integrates physical training and production, mirroring
          educational practices in refugee camps during its founding era. This
          approach ensures that students are not only academically competent but
          also skilled in practical and vocational areas.
